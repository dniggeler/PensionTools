# Tax calculators
The Swiss tax system is characterised by considerable tax autonomy of the cantons, which results in intense tax competition between the cantons and many different taxation systems. If you want to calculate the full taxable amount based on the yearly income or wealth, one needs to calculate tax on municipality, canton and federal level. Taxes driven by income and wealth are 
- income tax
- wealth tax
- capital benefits tax (withdrawals from Swiss pension systems)
- poll tax (imposed by a few cantons only)
